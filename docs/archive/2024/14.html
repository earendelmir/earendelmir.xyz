        <p>Last month I re-read <i>Dune</i>, to prepare myself before watching the new film — and what a spectacle that
        was! It delivered on any possible level; the score, the images,  ... epic!<br>
        Anyway, while still reading the novel, I decided to buy the second chapter of the series: <i>Dune Messiah</i>.<br>
        This post is a tale of trepidation, curiosity and, ultimately, disappointment. But first, a premise.</p>

        <p>I am truly picky when it comes to books. Before buying one, especially when shopping online, I always make sure
        it is the right edition — paperback — and has a cover I like.<br>
        I prefer paperbacks to hardcovers: lighter, easier to read and to carry around.<br>
        I also prefer physical copies to e-readers because I feel the need <s>for speed</s> to caress the paper with my fingers,
        to feel its texture, to switch hands when the book starts weighing on my arm. I want to witness the small creases
        that start forming on its spine as I progress, the slight curving of the first and last pages, and the increase
        in volume as I turn the pages<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1">[<a href="#fn-1">1</a>]</sup>.  Most importantly,
        though, I don't use an e-reader because I like collecting<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2">[<a href="#fn-2">2</a>]</sup>
        books, smelling them, staring at their covers and spines, and I cherish the ceremonial rite of adding new entries on the shelves.<br>
        Audiobooks? Heresy.</p>

        <p>When I first contemplated reading <i>Dune</i>, back in 2019, I looked online for the available editions and
        found none that satisfied me. I especially remember the confusion I felt, caused by the italian versions having
        different titles than the ones I found on the series' Wikipedia page. I couldn't find a book titled just <i>Dune</i>.
        At that time, the film had not yet been released, nor had it even been announced, so it's possible that no edition
        of the first novel was being published and sold by italian booksellers. The simpler truth is that I gave up on
        the hunt too easily.<br>
        In March 2020 I went on a short trip to London with my sister. There I bought an illustrated edition of <i>The
        Hobbit</i> (the first Tolkien's book I have ever read in English), and a marvelous edition of <i>Dune</i>.</p>

          <figcaption>My <i>Dune</i> copy</figcaption>
        </div>

        <p>I love the cover design! This use of... negative space? No, this can't be the right word. You know what I
        mean, though, this... minimalist look, I like it.</p>

        <p>When last week I browsed for <i>Dune Messiah</i>, I found a paperback edition that matched this design, with
        silhouettes cutting the backdrop to reveal the world behind.<br>
        Now, you can definitely understand the frustration I felt when I first laid my eyes on the book that I found in
        the mailbox.</p>

        <div class="img-div">

          <figcaption>My <i>Dune Messiah</i> copy</figcaption>
        </div>

        <p>I can't stress enough how I viscerally hate that sticker advertising the <i>mAjOr MoTIoN PiCtUrE</i>, and that
        line at the bottom quoting the Washington Post. Had I known of their presence I probably wouldn't have bought
        the book. Yes, I am that petty!<br>
        Not only they ruined the minimalism feel, they also tainted the book with <i>impure</i> sentences. Books are
        sacred. Books should not get mixed with cinema — which I love, don't get me wrong, I just wish publishers wouldn't
        take advantage of adaptations to sell more books, like they did with this fake sticker (had it been an actual
        sticker I could've attempted to remove it), or worse, when they release new editions with cover images taken
        from the film/show.<br>
        Also, all quotes from newspapers should be put on the back side, out of sight. Or, better yet, just stop quoting
        newspapers.</p>

            I read them. It's as if there's extra air caught between the pages after I've turned them for the first time.
