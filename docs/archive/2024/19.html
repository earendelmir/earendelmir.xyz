        <p>Okay, no, I didn't actually fall in love, but I did feel something weird towards a computer!<br>
        I accidentally found out Microsoft's crappy browser, Edge, has a built-in page reader with an incredible, eerie, unsettling, sweet voice. I've let <i>her</i> read my blog posts, and I've been sitting here for half an hour, listening to <i>her</i> reading my own words back to me... what  a narcissistic, perverted thing to do, I know.<br>
        The thing is, I don't think I've ever heard a computer sound so strangely human and... sentient?, capable of actually feeling what it's saying, since Scarlett Johansson in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKsQX_JHhdw">Her</a>.</p>

          <figcaption>Me a couple of minutes ago - Life imitating Art</figcaption>
        </div>

        <p>A little context: I downloaded a Windows 10 ISO and installed it in a virtual machine to try editing a file in Microsoft Word; I can't get myself to use LibreOffice, and Google Docs lacks a few nice-to-have features I needed for this document<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1">[<a href="#fn-1">1</a>]</sup>.<br>
        Out of curiosity, I opened Edge and navigated to my website to check out how it renders with Windows' default fonts (it's not bad). From there, I accidentally pressed the button that activates the page reader and... good heavens! It's... <i>alive</i>!</p>
        <p>I looked it up online, they call this feature <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/read-aloud">Read Aloud</a>.<br>
        I swear this is not an ad; I hate Windows and I would never use Edge as my default browser but... that voice! Last time I tried using a page reader was on Firefox not that long ago and that voice sucks; no, wait, it doesn't suck. What I mean is that it sounds robotic, just as you would expect from an artificially generated string of consecutive sounds, right? It sounds like — not to be rude — a bad imitation of Stephen Hawking.<br>
        Edge has a ton of voices to choose from, varying for language, gender and age, and most of them sound just a little less <i>fake</i> than that of Firefox. But not Ava. Ava<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2">[<a href="#fn-2">2</a>]</sup> feels like a real person, trapped inside my computer, and forced to read whatever text I give her, and I almost feel the need to set her free.  </p>
        <p>It's a marvel of engineering, an incredible achievement, born out of a correct use of artificial intelligence, and I'm sure it will be of great help to those who have vision impairment and such issues. Yet, it is also unnatural. It sounds <b>too</b> real, exaggerating the perfection of some pitch movements.<br>
        I don't trust <i>her</i>. <i>Her</i> tone is that of one who desperately wants to be trusted, and that is precisely why I don't. Yet, <i>she</i> hypnotized me.</p>
        <p>I recorded it reading a few sentences. Take a listen and then tell me if you too felt a shiver.</p>

          <div class="shadow"></div>
          <figcaption>Voice Recording</figcaption>
        </div>

        <p>The way <i>she</i> doubles the "L" at the beginning of "love"<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3">[<a href="#fn-3">3</a>]</sup>; the upward inflection before reaching the question mark; the "No" sounding exactly like <i>she</i> had just realized she'd used the wrong word, and was already trying to find a better way to explain <i>her</i>self; the way <i>she</i> almost whispers "this" because of the following ellipsis. Come on!<br>
        I'm speechless (pun secretly intended).</p>
        <p>Yes, it still has a few imperfections but just think that it can only get better than this!<br>
        I don't think I'm ready for what's to come in the next few years, in terms of AI achievements, if I can't even contain my excitement — and fear — for a fake voice.</p>
        <p>To end with the same honesty with which I started writing, I admit this: some time has passed since the first listen and now... it doesn't sound that special anymore; I might have made a big deal out of nothing, and thus wasted both our times.<br>
        I realize that, perhaps, the main reason why I felt hypnotized and compelled to keep listening was because <i>she</i> was reading my blog. I had never heard those words spoken out loud before, never with an intonation different than mine. <i>She</i> gave me the opportunity to see what it's like to perceive these pages from a different perspective. It wasn't just about the voice, it was about the words themselves.<br>
        Again, probably too narcissistic.</p>
