      <p>I was thinking my posts need catchier titles.<br>
      When I browse other people's blogs I find myself opening a dozen posts — all at once, on separate tabs.</p>

      <p><i>this is one of the things that separate a casual computer user from a "pro" (hate this word but can't think
      of another way to say it). i feel pity for those who google something, open the first link, go back to the search
      page, click on another link, go back, open another... no. you should always open in a new tab. always!</i></p>

      <p>I open a dozen posts because of their catchy titles. Then, I am left disappointed because, most of the times,
      the content does not live up to the expectations — but that's mostly on me, my wild fantasy and my naive belief
      that everybody thinks like I think.
      Nonetheless, it feels engaging. I like exploring other blogs, and <i>stealing</i> from them is thrilling.</p>

      <p>It usually goes like this: I find a blog (from a blogroll, a repository, a backlink from another blog...); I
      visit the /about page and then the archive; I open all the posts that seem interesting and start reading them.
      All the while, I keep an eye out for any cool feature or styling choice that I can incorporate in my own blog.<br>
      I'll be reading a post and suddenly stop to think <i>"that's a nice line-height they have here"</i>, or
      <i>"I should make my accent color brighter, the spacing between content and footer larger... increase
      accessibility, like they did"</i>.</p>

      <p>Such is the burden of a pure HTML/CSS implementation: complete control, infinite possibilities, everlasting
      tinkering.</p>

      <p>The latest inspiration has lead to the implementation of tags filtering in the /archive page. I have always
      wanted to add post tags, and I did at one point, but I was never satisfied with the looks and the UX, until now.<br>
      I have a whole draft for a post about tags that I hope to publish in the near future — don't know why it feels
      like an important topic.</p>

      <p>I guess we've arrived to the interesting bit, the introspective shit: this is all getting too serious.<br>
      Ever since I made this blog public, I started caring too much about its appearances. And I'm not only talking
      about the frequent changes to the CSS. This care reflects on the writing too: I am writing drafts, on separate
      markdown files? where does that come from?<br>
      I am limiting myself, delaying the publication of many thoughts, just because I write drafts that I never
      actually finish. There are six now. Six long-ish posts that await completion and revision — which I doubt will
      ever come.<br>
      There's this increased pressure I put on myself, to deliver something good and enjoyable to the reader. This...
      delusion! that I might actually have readers is weighing me down. I have become too self-conscious about my
      English — not to mention the fact that I seemingly stopped writing in Italian altogether, which is a
      shame.</p>

      <p>I should not care. And I don't. I don't care. Nobody is ever going to read this anyway — and I don't mean it
      in a self-pity, wallowing way but as the complete opposite, actually: nobody is going to read this so let's
      just write for the sake of emptying the mind and filling the page.</p>

      <p>I won't proof read this too many times. I won't fix the improper use of the em-dash, the misplaced commas and
      what not. I am just going to write, cause that's where the magic lies: in the fun and relaxing process of
      conjuring one word after the other, to express fleeting (yet important) thoughts and feelings.<br>
      I should also keep in mind that the real reason why this blog exists is to <i>collect</i> the results of my writing,
      not to <i>display</i> them.<br>
      Secondly, yes, I would also like for others to read — and possibly engage with me — but that's just the innate
      wanting for human connection that we all experience.</p>
