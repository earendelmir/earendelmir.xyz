        <p>Somebody posted online an email Steve Jobs sent to himself in 2010, a year before his passing. I've just read
        it for the first time.<br>
        Here's the text:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.<br>
        I do not make any of my own clothing.<br>
        I speak a language I did not invent or refine. I did not discover the mathematics I use.<br>
        I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.<br>
        I am moved by music I did not create myself.<br>
        When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive.<br>
        I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.<br>
        I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.</p>
        <p>Sent from my iPad</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>I don't want to write about Jobs, I won't comment on his life, his ethics, behaviors, whether he was a visionary
        or an aggressive and demanding boss.<br>
        I won't because I know close to nothing about him.</p>

        <p>What I do know is that he had some moments of reflections, like the one he poured into this email, and I
        salute him for that.<br>
        I happened to have similar thoughts once — feels presumptuous to say that (and I generally dislike when other
        people compare themselves to famous persons) but it's true.</p>

        <p>What I found most striking, however, is the last line of this email, which has even been omitted by some when
        quoting or reporting its contents:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>Sent from my iPad</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>It's poetic. A man coming to terms with the fact that his entire life was shaped, and every step made possible,
        only by the achievements of others, the progress of an entire species, over the span of countless years... and
        yet! he wrote that thought on his own creation, <i>his</i> contribution to humanity!<br>
        This was no accident; he clearly knew what he was doing by letting <i>that</i> line end the thought. Still, I
        can't help but feel happy for him; I can sense how proud he was of his creations, and the satisfaction with
        which he wrote this email.<br>
        Or maybe, I'm projecting something of mine onto him... I don't know.</p>
