      <p>Three days ago I passed my last exam<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1">[<a href="#fn-1">1</a>]</sup>. I
      had been putting it off for almost two years, mostly out of fear of failure, partly because of the childish,
      unjustified disgust I felt for the subject and the way it was taught.<br>
      I passed it with a grade of 24<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2">[<a href="#fn-2">2</a>]</sup> which was
      exactly the minimum I needed to still graduate with top marks. I can't explain how relieved I've been
      feeling these days, and free.<br>
      The morning after the exam I woke up from a sleep so pure and undisturbed as I had not had in a very long time.</p>

      <p>I actually remember the last time I slept so fine; it was in February 2019. That day I had just passed the last
      exam of my first semester at uni — noticing a pattern here.<br>
      I slept from 8pm to 8am. 12 hours, uninterrupted. I woke up feeling like I was reborn, zero worries and all the
      time in the world.<br>
      It was great and it was unique; I have not had such a profound sleep ever since. Even now that all exams are
      done I still have some anxiety caused by my thesis work.<br>
      But I'm content, this is definitely a novelty.</p>
