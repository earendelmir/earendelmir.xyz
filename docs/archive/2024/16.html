        <p>I cried watching <i>The Iron Claw</i>.<br>
        I cry for almost every film I watch but I didn't think I would this time. Right up to the end I felt moved, and I pitied the characters (and the real family) for the heartbreaking story, but I was also distracted by the funny-looking hair and muscles, and the accents.</p>

        <p>Then it hit me. Twice.</p>

        <p>Firstly with the scene of the last dead brother paddling his canoe in the quietness of the sunset. I felt the calmness — no, it was something more: absence. I was completely mesmerized, caught in the moment, and oblivious of the world around me, of the fact that I was watching scenes through a screen; I was in the canoe, and I was on the pier, I was one of the brothers.<br>
        And when he asked to see the little one! (whom I had forgot about)......</p>

        <p>Then, it hit me again, harder, when Zac Efron looks at his kids playing and starts crying, saying <i>"I used to be a brother and... well, now I'm not a brother anymore."</i><br>
        That's when my heart exploded and the sobbing started. I had never thought about it that way before. I was expecting a <i>"I used to</i> have <i>brothers"</i> but not <i>that</i>. I guess that's true, though. If you lose your sibling(s) a part of yourself dies with them.</p>

        <p>I don't want to loose my sister. I don't want to stop being a brother.</p>

        <p>Also, Zac Efron is a great actor. And so are them all.</p>
