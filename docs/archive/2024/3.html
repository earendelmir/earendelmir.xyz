      <p>I want to live a simple life, quiet.<br>
      I want money to sustain myself without having to worry, but I don't care about being rich. I want my own
      apartment, with white furniture from IKEA and many green plants, but I don't care about living in a
      proper house, with a garden, a garage and all that. I want a job that is secure and that I can enjoy working
      at for rest of my life, but I don't care about becoming ceo or leader or whatever.</p>

      <p>I was never a competitive child either. I never cared for medals or being (one of) the best.<br>
      Problem is, I was the best, at school. And when you are good at school (without studying hard) they all expect
      great things from you. <i>I</i> expect great things from me — or... I don't know, I guess I used to; now I
      just hope to get by.</p>

      <p>I want quiet days, I want to pass through this life with as little fuss as possible.<br>
      It may be a waste. But how can ambition, and consequent struggle, be better than being content?</p>

      <p>Most people won't agree with me. Most people will be far more successful than me, some (of my peers) already
      are.<br>
      What is success, though? A higher paying job? Being promoted? Fancy cars and clothes and shit? I feel more
      successful than most when I look up at the sky and let myself be in awe of the firmament. I feel successful
      when I walk through the trees and let myself breathe with them. I feel successful when I experience love:
      family love, friends love, and <i>love</i> love.<br>
      Too cheesy? I want a cheesy life, then.</p>

      <p><i>i wrote a draft for this post last night, after a dinner with friends at a local winery
      <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1">[<a href="#fn-1">1</a>]</sup> — how special is that place!<br>
      this morning i woke up early to come to university and i looked up and... how mesmerizing, that sunrise!
      different colors in every direction, small clouds, crisp air... lovely!</i></p>

      <p>Maybe my mind is just trying to protect my feelings from the inevitable defeat I will suffer in the game of life.
      After all, who doesn't want a bigger house? a bigger paycheck? I am convincing myself that I don't, so that
      I won't feel bad when I won't get it.<br>
      Or maybe, I am simply too scared of commitment; if I don't work hard for something great, then I won't be
      disappointed when it doesn't come my way.</p>

      <p>Now, all I have is guilt, which is better than disappointment because, when feeling guilty about myself and my
      actions, I can at least hope to make a change; when feeling disappointed, there's no hope — it's over.</p>
