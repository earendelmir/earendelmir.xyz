        <p>I'm no longer a fan of this word, productivity. Far too many self-proclaimed internet gurus are using it to describe impossible (if not fake) methods to get more stuff done.</p>

        <p>You know, I just realized there's not much I like about the current state of the internet, or the world, for that matter. I would not want to live in a reality without the internet, yet I'm pretty sure there are countless better ways We could have handled the web, without turning it into a profit-oriented land of bots, influencers, and divisive, attention-grabbing content.</p>

        <p>By the way, I kind of love how whenever I sit down to write about something, I almost always get sidetracked by other topics. It's a testament to the quantity of thoughts I have bottled up inside. It sounds arrogant, like <i>"ooh look! look how many thoughts i have, and on soo many topics!"</i>. It is actually the premise of a scary realization: I don't <i>think</i> anymore, I stopped pondering, reflecting, deciding, having opinions. I just consume music, books, movies, blogs, ..., all day long. I'd do anything to keep my mind distracted.<br>
        The worst part is, I'm getting worse at that too. I have no strength to look for new movies, no interest in new tv shows (I keep re-watching random episodes of <i>Modern Family</i> and <i>Community</i>), and music has slowly become a background noise — even now, writing this, I have the marvelous Joni Mitchell playing but I've not given her a single thought until this moment.</p>

        <p>What has become of me? An empty shell that used to fill himself with random stuff and now has lost the will power to do that too.<br>
        I'm tired. And I'm tired of using <i>"I'm tired"</i> as an excuse for my present condition! I'm wasting my days.</p>

        <p>When I look at what I write I feel pity for this blog, I'd wish for it to be a happier place, collecting nice memories and interesting words, instead of this sad, boring stuff. Nonetheless, I feel grateful such a place exists, where I can write whatever I'm feeling without fearing any judgement.<br>
        This too shall pass, and I'm sure I'll pivot to nicer content.</p>

        <blockquote>But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it'll shine out the clearer.</blockquote>

        <p>I don't want to write about my phone anymore. It doesn't feel right.<br>
        I'll leave the title, though. Accuse me of click-baiting, I don't care.</p>
