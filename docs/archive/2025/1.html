        <p>Rotting in bed all day. I can't wait to go back to work. For some reason, some of us are not admitted back to work until some of the chiefs on the upper floors sign some documents. They are paying me to stay at home and do nothing; the dream! ... the dream? I'm not sure. I want to see my colleagues again, I want to distract myself and not spend the entire day in bed. I should also clean the bathroom, change the sheets, remove the dust with the aspirapolvere (can't think of the English word, won't bother to look it up).<br>
        I could take a walk, yes, but to go where? Anywhere would do, this is a small but nice town, I could finally see the centre with all its shops while they are open during the day, with sunlight! But I should take a shower first, I smell and my hair is dirty. I can't go out like this. I promise I'll do it tomorrow. Even if I wanted to do it now, my accappatoio (the robe you put on after the shower, don't know the word) is still lying wet on the drying rack.</p>

        <p>I'm feeling blue because I broke up with my girlfriend right before I left my hometown, on the 2nd of this month. I feel bad. It was not entirely my decision to leave her, I was pressured by my friends, and I was <i>forced</i> by my mother. Nobody likes her and her family, and they think she is not "enough" for me.<br>
        Deep down I know they are right, I don't think our story would've lasted forever, we would have definitely started hating each other's lifestyles and choices... but that would have been in a remote future, right now we were happy together! We have fun, we are sweet, we have a connection and feel attraction towards one another. That was enough to keep us going, to keep the spark and interest alive, the curiosity.<br>
        We also desire each other, something neither of us had never felt before — not that intensely, at least.<br>
        Now it's over. If that was not bad enough, more trouble arose: she is now fighting everyone (me excluded), and everyone (me excluded) is fighting her. Our parents meddled and made the whole situation worse, and that is what I most feared would happen.<br>
        At least I am away from everybody........</p>

        <p>I want to read more, and write more.<br>
        One thing they got right: she had taken up too much space in my life. Between work and house management I had little time for myself, and I spent all of it talking to her or thinking about her. I stopped reading, stopped watching movies, stopped writing, and the biggest mistake of them all! I also stopped playing music — not true, I still played but less frequently.</p>

        <p>I want to read more, yes, but I don't have any books here with me. Well, I have The Lord of the Rings but I've read it so many times already, I am tired of it (for now!). I should buy some other book, I already have some ideas, I just... I am not fond of the idea of spending more money; I've been spending so much lately! I should be more careful. Still... it's books I'm talking about, not candy or cigarettes or useless crap. We'll see.</p>

        <p>I want to write more. I'm doing it already! I probably shouldn't mention the fact that I tried writing a new post for the last two days. I turned on the computer, opened Obsidian, created an empty document and... nothing. But here I am now, writing nonsensical things. Good for me. At least, I don't feel like I'm wasting my time.</p>

        <p>This is full of errors, and sentences built in the Italian manner of writing. Sorry, whoever you are.<br>
        I don't even think there's anybody who will read this. I know there are people who found my blog, but that was months ago, when I was still active. Now... boh</p>
