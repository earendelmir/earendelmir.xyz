        <p>I joined two dating apps.<br>
        I'm scared of Tinder because it's the most popular and people who know me might come across my profile, and I'm ashamed. I'm scared they might make fun of me — not because I'm on a dating app, but rather because of what they would think of my profile and prompts/photos.<br>
        I finally confess: I'm self-conscious (who would have thought!).</p>

        <p>I'd like to meet new people to build my confidence, make new experiences, and especially to discover new places/things to do here in Rome.</p>

        <p>I don't think I'll find my soulmate, at most I'll have a brief relationship (or <i>situationship</i>) but I'm fine with it.<br>
        The thing is, the people I know I would have a great connection with, they most definitely are not on dating apps.</p>

        <p>The way I've always perceived these sites is: they're like a market — no, a bookstore. All you can do is <i>judge by the cover</i>, and I don't think that's a healthy approach... at least, I didn't. I've been on these apps for a few days now, and I notice I've already started giving in: I'm swiping so fast now!, thinking "<i>too pretty, too ugly, too tall, too old, too ..., not enough ..., too ..., not enough ..., ...</i>".<br>
        I don't like this behaviour. I'm becoming too shallow.</p>

        <p>Also, dating apps exist to make money for their companies, not to help the customer. I know I'm not getting the best recommendations I could get. If I did, I would find love right away and uninstall the app.<br>
        Instead, the goal is to keep me thinking I'm always one swipe away from finding the right one. That way, there's an increased chance I might pay for a premium subscription.<br>
        It's sad that I recognize this scam and yet I keep swiping.</p>

        <p>At first, I only sent likes; I was shy and didn't know what to say. Now I take it as a game, a challenge to find the best pick-up line I can. I don't care if it doesn't work, I like the fun of it.</p>

        <p>Also, I want to fuck. So... there's that too.</p>
