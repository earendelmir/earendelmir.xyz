        <p>I recognize now the symptoms of my depression.</p>

        <p>I need to specify that it is not clinical, it's momentary — at least I think so.<br>
        I feel blue, but it's <i>only</i> because I'm going through a breakup, which has blown up and now involves and hurts many people, instead of us two only.</p>

        <p>The symptoms:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I shower and brush my teeth less frequently</li>
          <li>I stop doing skincare</li>
          <li>I don't go out much</li>
          <li>I reply less and less to friends and family on WhatsApp, and when I do I might come off as grumpy or disinterested</li>
          <li>Sleep is worse</li>
          <li>I don't eat regularly, and when I do it's mostly chocolate</li>
          <li>I feel like I have no energy</li>
          <li>I masturbate more but with less... <i>desire</i></li>
          <li>I binge youtube videos about stuff I don't even really care about</li>
          <li>I scroll endlessly on Instagram for funny reels</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Basically... I completely give up, and I let my addictions have the best of me.<br>
        No more. Tomorrow will be different.<br>
        I'll fix the easiest stuff: I'll brush my teeth, do skincare before going to bed, I won't open Instagram, and eat less chocolate.</p>

        <p>The problem with chocolate is that my parents bought it for me. I didn't want it, I swear! They say I'm getting too skinny and are worried for me... we truly are a stereotypical (southern) Italian family lol.</p>

        <p>I'll slowly try to fix the other problems too. I did not masturbate today, already a win. And I don't think I'll do it tomorrow either.<br>
        On Monday I'll have a shower and I'll go out. I'll go to the <i>vivaio</i> (how do you call the plant store??) and ask for some guidance; I want to buy a small plant to put on the dresser in my bedroom. I'm scared that any plant would not survive there because when I go to work I close the blinds and no sunlight enters the room.</p>

        <p>Anyway, bottom line is: I feel like shit and I can't wait to go back to work, to take my mind off of it and concentrate on work problems instead.</p>

        <p>What I find reassuring is that I am recognizing these problems — no, even better: it's the fact that these "habits" are only appearing now because I'm blue. When things go fine I am a different, better person.<br>
        It's reassuring, and a consolation, it means I can escape this and start being a better, more conscious and cleaner person once again... but it's also a clear sign that things are not fine, and I do not feel fine AT ALL!</p>

        <p>aAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</p>

        <p>Goodnight!</p>
