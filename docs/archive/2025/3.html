        <p>I almost cried this morning. I have no idea how but I stumbled upon the Catfish &amp; The Bottlemen's profile on Spotify. It's been so long since the last time I heard their music, and I decided to look for some of my old favourites.<br>
        I was almost moved to tears while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkDLsioZRTk">7</a> was playing on my Alexa speaker in the kitchen. It's definitely not because of the lyrics, which I've never played much attention to; I almost cried because of the memories associated to that band, the memories of a different time of my life now long gone.</p>
        
        <p>There were different people, different hopes for the future, and a smaller, more innocent and less understanding view of the world.</p>
        
        <p>I was 16 at the time. I have no age now. I stopped growing, I'm not even getting old, I'm just letting life happen and adjusting to whatever comes my way.<br>
        I'm not fighting. I never did.</p>
        
        <p>I know this band because a friend of mine suggested it to me. She was dear to me, even though I've only been her friend for a very short period of time: no more than a year... at least that is what I remember, maybe it was less time, maybe a little more. We met in July of... uhmmmmm 2016?, for the Giffoni Film Festival, and kept staying in touch for many months after. After a while, we slowly, gradually started drifting apart. It's no surprise: she lived in Rome, far from me, and even when I went to Rome to visit my aunt, we did not meet up — that's my fault, though: I did not ask her.<br>
        I have no idea where she is now, or what she's doing. I should look her up on Instagram, hoping she doesn't have a private profile.</p>
        
        <p>One of the happiest, most funny, care-free moments of my life happened with her. I will always be grateful to her for that; I am grateful that our paths crossed, even if just for a short journey.</p>
        
        <p>I wonder if she ever thinks about me. I hope she does...<br>
        I'd hate to know — hell! to even think — that my nostalgia is unmatched.</p>

        <p><small>Update, 15 minutes later</small></p>
        
        <p>WHAT THE FUCK!!</p>
        
        <p>She moved to Japan! AND got married (in 2023)!<br>
        I have no words... so random and unexpected!</p>
        
        <p>She became one of those people obsessed with Japanese culture. I would have never seen it coming.<br>
        I'm happy for her, she seems to be doing well. I know on social medias we only post the good moments, but still... she seems fine. I'm happy for her, and amazed!</p>
