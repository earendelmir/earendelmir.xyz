      <p>If you were to look up my name on Google this website would show up among the results.<br>
        This is it. It's happening! This is truly, finally, "out there".</p>

      <p>I'm scared.</p>

      <p>I think, now that it comes to it, I don't actually want people to read my thoughts — well, not <i>all</i>
        people; I don't care about strangers, they can read all they want! but if you do know me then... please, stop.<br>
        Please, stop reading — wait no, that's not it! do as you please!<br>
        I just realised it's not your reading that scares me, it's what might follow: it's the «<i>Why didn't you tell
        me you had a blog?</i>», the «<i>Look what I found! Is this yours?</i>», all the questions and comments I don't
        think I have answers for.</p>


      <p>I guess... there's no going back now, is there?</p>

      <p><i>yes. yes, there is. i'm just being melodramatic. i could always take this down and keep living as if nothing
        happened. that is not what i want, though... that is not what i want.</i></p>

      <blockquote>I must not fear.<br>
        Fear is the mind-killer.<br>
        Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.<br>
        I will face my fear.
      </blockquote>

      <p>I will face my fear. Life is too short to stop and cower before your comments and your judgement. Fuck you.</p>

      <p>Also, all of this would only matter IF (and that is a big if) somebody were to actually google me. Who would do that?<br>
        I guess it was a little presumptuous of me to worry about it in the first place.</p>
