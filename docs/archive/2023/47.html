      <p>God</p>

      <p><i>see? here's the first problem: which god am i talking about? the one you're thinking? probably, but that is
        only a result of centuries of religious colonization</i></p>

      <p>God is an answer to most of our primordial questions: why are we here, what happens after death, are we alone,
        what is our purpose on Earth, ...<br>
        God is convenient; He comes in handy when we have to face our biggest, oldest, still unresolved fear(s): death,
        oblivion, the end of all things. He truly is a Light.</p>

      <p>I envy those who believe; I envy them for their blind faith. Blind because of the trust and sense of complete
        safety, of surrender; blind because of the unwillingness to answer — or even ask — some basic, eye-opening
        questions like <i>"Why are there so many religions?"</i>, <i>"Wouldn’t you say that you only believe in a Christian
        God because you were born and raised in a Christian environment?"</i>,
        <i>"How could God let all these innocent people suffer needlessly with wars and famine and child diseases
        and ...?"</i></p>

      <p>I do not believe in the existence of god, any of them.<br>
        Not believing is still <i>believing</i>, it is not <i>knowing</i>. I see my atheism as faith in my (not
        <i>the</i>, my) truth, more than a lack of it.<br>
        In the end, we must see that nobody is right and nobody is wrong; we will only know for certain after our death
        so... live and let die.</p>

      <p>And yet, the Christian God is the one I do not believe in the most; He is the one I most want to dismiss as a
        fantasy because... He seems to me the worst example of a god.<br>
        All monotheistic religions are unappealing to me: the idea of an omnipotent being constantly spying,
        making sure we do not disobey him, not even in thought and pondering, and rewarding those who live in perpetual
        fear with an eternal afterlife, is simply not worthwhile; I want happiness and freedom, now, in this life, and
        I want to behave ethically thanks to my simple morality, not out of fear of eternal punishment.</p>

      <p>Also, I feel like Christian mythology is... bland. It takes itself too seriously and does not tolerate fun,
        entertaining or ironic moments involving the main characters.<br>
        Take polytheistic religions instead</p>

      <p><i>not all of them, I am only talking about the ones I know something about: greek (and roman) and norse</i></p>

      <p>I like those better. They have an entire pantheon of Gods, each with its own qualities and flaws that
        reflect the humans'. Their mythology is full of fun, tragic, mysterious, emotional stories, and that is because</p>

      <p><i>i am no expert, do not take my word for it</i></p>

      <p>because (1) the presence of multiple deities who can interact with each other allows for the creation of stories
        far more entertaining, and (2) these deities were not taboo: playwrights, writers, poets, they all had the
        freedom to incorporate their Gods in their work to create hilarious theatre plays and farces, poignant poems and
        epic stories.<br>
        God has been the subject/object of artistic work too but you have to admit how His character is always perfect,
        unreachable, heavenly superior. Compare that with what we know of Zeus: always horny, quick to anger,
        a great father figure — when caring to be involved... see the difference? Zeus is human. Zeus is a man with
        superpowers and little self-control.<br>
        The entire pantheon is made up of characters created in likeness of mankind. God is created in likeness of
        what mankind wishes to be but fails to.</p>

      <p>I feel like I have gone a little off topic. I have said both too much and not enough, this is no easy topic.</p>
