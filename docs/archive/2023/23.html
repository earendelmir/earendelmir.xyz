      <p>Who art thou, reading this, reading my thoughts? You're definitely not me! I know eventually I'll get
        bold enough to make this website public, so I ask you again: who are you? what do you like? dislike? is this
        the first post of mine you've ever clicked on, or are you a regular customer? what do you think of me?<br>
        I know I'll eventually get bold enough to make this website public, and therein lies the problem, my friend:<br>
        I write for others, I write knowing this might be read by strangers, or worse, people I know. That is
        such a presumptuous and delusional thought! but, nonetheless, my freedom of speech is limited by it. I
        hardly ever touch on more personal (possibly disconcerting) topics even though <i>I know</i> it would only
        do me good to put my thoughts in words.<br>
        I should write for myself.<br>
        As far as I see it, this "experiment" can only go one of three ways:</p>

      <h2>This stays mine</h2>
      <p>I start writing more about the private, important stuff, promising to myself it will never be published. My ego
        will take the hurt in favour of a mythologically better state of mind resulting from this therapeutic behaviour.</p>

      <h2>This becomes yours</h2>
      <p>I start writing about the private stuff but I also <i>grow a pair</i> and publish all of it. Who cares.
        Nobody will ever read it anyway.</p>

      <h2>One for you, one for me</h2>
      <p>I start writing about the private stuff on a different platform. I make two websites: one for you and one for me.<br>
        This last option gives <i>evil plan</i> vibes and I low-key like it.</p>

      <hr>
      <p>P.S. This sudden need to write in English is either a way to dissociate from myself or the result of
        listening to Taylor Swift on repeat this last couple of days. (boy, that can never be made public!)</p>
