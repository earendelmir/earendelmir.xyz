      <p>I surrendered to <a href="/archive/2023/34">my insecurities</a> and switched to a different domain that
        does not contain my full name.<br>
        I felt too exposed and I could not live with that "pressure".</p>

      <p>Actually, the reason for the switch is a little more specific: the exposure made me feel too restrained
        to write freely on here.<br>
        It was not the fear in itself — the fear of being discovered by those who know me in real life; it was not that
        what forced my hand but rather the lack of freedom that said fear caused in me.<br>
        I want this space to be mine, and I want this space to feel safe — this I have not explicitly admitted before.</p>

      <p>I want this space to feel safe for me.<br>
        A safe haven. An hidden clearing in the forest only I know about, where to spend intimate moments of my life
        and reflect, collect myself when I feel most vulnerable, excited, angry, full of fear or joy.</p>

      <h2>Total anonymity?</h2>
      <p>Not quite. The domain (and website title) is a short version of my name and I believe I have some links
        in my /about page — and a PROFILE PICTURE! I almost forgot that teeny tiny small detail lol; so no, I am
        not completely anonymous.<br>
        But that is fine. I do not strive to be invisible, I just don't want those who know me to be able to find me
        as easily as it is to google my name.</p>

      <p><i>as i've already said before, i know it is a bit presumptuous by my part to assume anyone is ever going to
        google me but one can never be too cautious</i></p>

      <p>And I already feel more at ease; for example, before I would have never used "lol" — yeah, I'm that full of hang-ups
        — and now I just did!<br>
        And I already feel the need to write more! to write about more private stuff — if only I had the time!</p>

      <h2>Why keep this public, then?</h2>
      <p>I have thought about deleting it but yesterday evening I've lived (what i know to be) a spiritual experience.<br>
        I was browsing through the repository of blogs hosted via <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear</a> (I like
        how minimal most of them are, their themes are similar to my styling) and I stumbled upon one particular website.<br>
        I won't link it here because, after reading a couple of posts, I realised that blog is supposed to be "a secret"; the
        owner uses that space to dump all of their innermost thoughts, often criticizing their spouse (even referring to
        him with his real name) — with whom! they keep a public, non-secret, shared blog!! — ranting about their
        relationship with the mother, and talking about other private, intimate aspects of their life.</p>

      <p>I thought about why would that person keep that website public and not write offline. I don't have an answer to
        that, but I do know how I felt reading those confessions: human.<br>
        I felt alive, in touch with <i>their</i> emotions and, by strange consequence, aware of <i>mine</i>!<br>
        I'm grateful for having stumbled on that space, I'm grateful for the owner's capacity of feeling comfortable
        enough to share all of their thoughts with us, <i>stranger readers</i>.</p>

      <p>I think you see where I'm going with this, my <i>stranger reader</i>. I keep this public in the hope that somebody
        might find, through these words of mine, the courage, shelter, peace, determination needed to <i>keep going</i>.</p>

      <h2>lowercase</h2>
      <p>In a definitely less impactful way, I also decided to turn most of my website lowercase.<br>
        I don't know why but I feel calmer when titles and headers are lowercase, they feel less threatening.</p>

      <h2>Finances</h2>
      <p>This domain switch cost me some money: €2.50.<br>
        I know, I know, it's nothing! But part of me still feels guilty. I have deleted the first domain in a frantic
        rush — a domain for which I still had 10 months of use, already paid. It feels like a waste, but I don't regret it.</p>
