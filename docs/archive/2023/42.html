      <h2 style="margin-top: 1rem;">The state of things</h2>
      <p>Deleting my social media profiles has been hard, but I did it. Now, I can confidently say it has been for the
        best, I miss none of them — except for Instagram: when I watch a movie I feel the need to read everything I can
        about it's making, it's reception and about the cast; I used to browse the actors' profiles and now I can’t do
        that anymore. Honestly, though, if that's the only thing I miss about Instagram, I can totally live with myself.</p>

      <p>Youtube is the only social media I still use. I never really cared about the <i>social</i> part, only the <i>media</i>.
        I spend HOURS every day on that site, watching curious, entertaining and informative videos about? everything!
        music, philosophy, literature, science, but also funny sketches and shows, and video essays! I can't even begin
        to express my love for video essays! But I also watch a ton of useless crap.</p>

      <p>By the way, on a definitely related note, I feel like the quality of both the content and the recommendations
        algorithm have decreased a lot lately. I figured this has to do with the platform pushing for the Shorts format.<br>
        I HATE SHORTS! they devour my brain, they leave me feeling empty, dull, numb.<br>
        I reach a point where I suddenly feel like my eyes have just opened, my brain just woken up and I realise
        <i>"wait, how long have I been watching shorts?"</i>. Me, who has always been proud for having avoided the
        TikTok trap, is just as addicted as the others...</p>

      <p>It is clearly time for me to do something about it.</p>

      <h2 id="disinterested">The disinterested solution</h2>
      <p>"Find other hobbies and activities to fill up your day with"<br>
        To me, that simply sounds too easy to actually work, it’s like asking a disinterested parent how to do something
        and being answered «just do it».<br>
        Look, if you have no other stimulating activity then this idea might work for you; find something else, anything!
        and you’ll do just fine.<br>
        I find myself in a trickier situation. I have many hobbies: playing music, reading books, blogs and articles,
        writing, going out for walks, coding, ... and I don’t feel like I don’t have time to pursue them, I just wish I
        spent less time watching stupid videos.<br>
        I need a more practical solution.</p>

      <h2>What actually helps</h2>

      <h3>Delete the account</h3>
      <p>I got over the other socials pretty quickly once I deleted my accounts, and I've just learned I could
      delete the Youtube one without loosing the entire Google account (I thought they were one and the same). So,
      I guess deleting this account too would rid me of the social media temptation for good — but I don't want to!
      as I said above, I watch some pretty interesting stuff and I'd like to keep updated on some channels.</p>

      <h3>Block the website</h3>
      <p>I also won't block the site with some browser extension because (1) I already tried and found myself disabling
      it not long after (2) I would not be able to watch those interesting videos mentioned above.</p>

      <h3>Delete the mobile app</h3>
      <p>Done months ago, never looked back. Problem is I spend most of my day on the computer.</p>

      <h3>Disable autoplay</h3>
      <p>Never had it on, it was too unpredictable and annoying when I happened to leave a tab open on the browser and
      a video would start playing without me knowing.</p>

      <h3>Unsubscribe from excess channels</h3>
      <p>I got the list and asked myself <i>"have I watched (or wanted to watch but they didn't upload) a video from
      this channel in the last month?"</i>. I unsubscribed whenever the answer was <i>"No"</i>. Starting at 150, I
      ended up with <i>only</i> 30 subscriptions but — I need to mention — most of the spared channels upload a video
      once every blue moon.</p>

      <h3>Disable adblock</h3>
      <p>I am conflicted about this one. The pros? I would be supporting those creators I actually care about; and that
      15 seconds of wait add extra fiction to the habit. The cons? Ads.</p>

      <h3>Disable Youtube search history</h3>
      <p>I just did this, it seems the perfect solution. I found the suggestion in this
      <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/c26jt9/advice_turn_off_youtube_recommendations_to_stop/">reddit post</a>.
      It points to this google's <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://myactivity.google.com/activitycontrols">account settings</a>
      page where to disable the Youtube activity and clear the entire watch history.<br>
      It worked like a charm! When I open Youtube now, the home page is empty! There are no recommendations and it
      seems there will never be!<br>
      The question here is: won't that prevent me from discovering new interesting videos/channels? Yes, yes it will.
      But I can't expect to decrease my usage if I'm always looking for new stuff. In any case, recommendations still
      appear to the side of a video, but those do not scare me because (1) I rarely notice them and (2) they are
      inherent to something I am actually curious about.</p>

      <h3>Add channels to RSS feed</h3>
      <p>So, what happens now is that I can open the Youtube homepage and see literally NOTHING except for a
      notification when one of the channels I follow posts something.<br>
      There's still room for improvement, though: I can add those channels to my RSS feed.<br>
      By doing so I don't even need to open the website to know when something new is available. No more temptations!<br>
      I check my RSS feed → A new video is available → I watch it → I close the site.<br>
      Boom. Quick and precise. No scrolling, no stupid Shorts. No distractions.</p>

      <br>
      <p>I'll probably post an update in a month or two. I truly hope this will work.</p>
