      <p>It's that time of the year! Funny (almost pitiful) with how much trepidation I await this day.<br>
      It's like Christmas coming early! It's like my horoscope, only better; I love being psychoanalysed by big
      corporations who base their results on countless private data they collect on me while I, their product, use
      their "product"!</p>

      <h2>Top Artists</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Taylor Swift</li>
        <li>Pooh</li>
        <li>Bear McCreary</li>
        <li>Laufey</li>
        <li>Howard Shore</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Taylor Swift being number one surprised me — no, it disappointed me. I knew she would be one of the top ones;
      I just hoped she would be 2nd place, Pooh being first.<br>
      I feel like I listened to her music a lot in late spring / early summer when the Eras Tour was going strong,
      but I gradually stopped in the second half of this year.</p>
      <p>McCreary and Shore? I have a playlist dedicated to movie soundtracks that I use as background music when I
      get tired of lo-fi, and I guess it happens a lot. I knew some movie score composer would be here; I just
      hoped it would only be one of them.<br>
      It feels like a waste to have them on the list because I don't consider them as actual artists — I know, it
      sounds bad. I do like their work and I admire them but I wish I could see the names of actual
      singers/songwriters on that list.</p>
      <p>Laufey? Love her.</p>
      <p>I'd say my dream list would have been, ordered: Pooh - Taylor Swift - Laufey - RAYE - Lucio Dalla.</p>

      <h2>Top Songs</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Mastermind - Taylor Swift</li>
        <li>Maroon - Taylor Swift</li>
        <li>Getaway Car - Taylor Swift</li>
        <li>illicit affairs - Taylor Swift</li>
        <li>Disaster Master - Nanna</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Makes sense. Maybe just a bit too biased? Like, it makes me feel bad for the countless other songs I enjoyed
      listening to? But it makes sense — actually, I thought Maroon would beat Mastermind. Strange.<br>
      Pleased to see Nanna's work on here. I listened to her album on repeat for a whole month.</p>

      <h2>Top Genre</h2>
      <p>Classic Italian Pop</p>
      <p>Nothing to see here: viva i Pooh, viva Dalla, Morandi, Renato Zero, Cocciante, Venditti...</p>

      <h2>Minutes Listened</h2>
      <p>57'009</p>
      <p>These will never be enough. I'll never be satisfied until I see 525'600.<br>
        Last year it was 37'719 (saying this just so that I can remember in future).</p>
