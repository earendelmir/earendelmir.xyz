  {a: "Before Sunrise", t: "That‚Äôs what I like about traveling ‚Äì you can sit down, maybe talk to someone interesting, see something beautiful, read a good book, and that‚Äôs enough to qualify as a good day. You do that at home and everyone thinks you‚Äôre a bum."},
  {a: "Before Sunset", t: "I guess when you are young, you believe that you will meet many people with whom you'll connect with, but later in life you realize it only happens a few times."},

  {a: "C.S. Lewis", t: "Eating and reading are two pleasures that combine admirably."},
  {a: "C.S. Lewis", t: "I can't imagine a man really enjoying a book and reading it only once."},

  {a: "Carlos Ruiz Zaf√≥n", t: "Every book has a soul. The soul of the person who wrote it and of those who read it and lived and dreamed with it. Every time a book changes hands, every time someone runs his eyes down its pages, its spirit grows and strengthens."},
  {a: "Carlos Ruiz Zaf√≥n", t: "Destiny is usually just around the corner. Like a thief, a hooker, or a lottery vendor: its three most common personifications. But what destiny does not do is home visits. You have to go for it."},

  {a: "Emily Dickinson", t: "Beauty is not caused. It is."},
  {a: "Everything Everywhere All At Once", t: "You think because l'm kind that it means I'm naive, and maybe I am. It's strategic and necessary. This is how I fight."},
