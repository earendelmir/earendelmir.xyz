      <p>I'm an Italian computer engineer dreaming of living a hobbit life. Until that happens, I keep myself entertained with music, novels, video essays, and shell scripting.<br>
      Random but <b>super important</b> facts about me:<br>
      I'm a fan of minimalism in design and technology; my comfort movies are mostly spaghetti westerns, christmassy
      rom-coms, and Studio Ghibli films; there's nothing I find more pleasant than going to bed with clean sheets after an
      evening shower.</p>
    </div>

    <p>If that is not enough, I have prepared a description through <a href="/gallery/memes">memes</a>, because...
    why not. Also, take a look at what I'm doing <a href="/about/now">now</a>.</p>

    <h2>Why earendelmir?</h2>
    <p>It's a pseudonym, created to conceal my actual name.<br>
    From a fusion of Old-English and Elvish, it means <i>"<b>Jewel of the Morning Star</b>"</i>. This is a nod to Tolkien's
    work, which has played, and continues to play, a significant role in shaping my imagination, philosophy, and emotional
    intelligence.</p>

    <h2>This website</h2>
    <p>It's my own little corner of the internet, and I love it! I'll tend to it as if it was my garden; it will grow as
    I grow, and die as I die.</p>

    <h3>What?</h3>
    <p>I could give a heartfelt description of how much I've come to love small blogs and the intimate connection that
    exists between the writer and the reader, the bond of trust, even love! that I feel when reading of other people's
    thoughts, and the desire I felt to create something equally special... but I'll spare you all of that.<br>
    In the end, this is just a comfortable <b>side project</b> to waste time on.</p>

    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>I started working on this for two reasons: <b>to be master</b> of style, form and content of my space here on the
    web, enabling me to customize it however I want and to express myself freely — the exact opposite of what social
    media offer. Secondly, <b>to store</b> all my thoughts and writings in a single place, overcoming the dependency on
    countless journals, pieces of paper, and note taking apps.</p>

    <h3>How?</h3>
    <p>The entire website is written in plain <b>HTML/CSS</b>, with as little <b>Javascript</b> as possible.<br>
    While being a perpetual <a href="/todo/">work in progress</a>, this site is <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last">designed to last</a>.
    Here's the <a href="https://github.com/earendelmir/earendelmir.xyz">source code</a>.</p>

    <h3>Privacy</h3>
    <p>There are <b>no <span translate="no">trackers</span></b>, analytics, nor <span translate="no">cookies</span>. I don't care
    who you are, where you are or why you've come here.<br>
    Also, I don't really want to know the number of readers: it would either be <span style="font-family: var(--font-monospace);">0</span> or
    <span style="font-family: var(--font-monospace);">>0</span> and I'd obsess over nothing in both scenarios.</p>
