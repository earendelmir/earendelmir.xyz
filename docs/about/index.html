      <p>I'm an Italian computer engineer dreaming of living a hobbit life. Until that happens, I keep myself entertained with music, novels, video essays, and shell scripting.<br>
      Random but <b>super important</b> facts about me:<br>
      I'm a fan of minimalism in design and technology; my comfort movies are mostly spaghetti westerns, christmassy
      rom-coms, and Studio Ghibli films; there's nothing I find more pleasant than going to bed with clean sheets after an
      evening shower.</p>
    </div>

    <p>If that is not enough, I have prepared a description through <a href="/gallery/memes">memes</a>, because...
    why not. Also, take a look at what I'm doing <a href="/about/now">now</a>.</p>

    <h2>Why earendelmir?</h2>
    <p>It's a pseudonym, created to conceal my actual name.<br>
    From a fusion of Old-English and Elvish, it means <i>"<b>Jewel of the Morning Star</b>"</i>. This is a nod to Tolkien's
    work, which has played, and continues to play, a significant role in shaping my imagination, philosophy, and emotional
    intelligence.</p>

    <h2>This website</h2>
    <p>It's my own little corner of the internet, and I love it! I'll tend to it as if it was my garden; it will grow as
    I grow, and die as I die.</p>

    <h3>What?</h3>
    <p>I could give a heartfelt description of how much I've come to love small blogs and the intimate connection that
    exists between the writer and the reader, the bond of trust, even love! that I feel when reading of other people's
    thoughts, and the desire I felt to create something equally special... but I'll spare you all of that.<br>
    In the end, this is just a comfortable <b>side project</b> to waste time on.</p>

    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>I started working on this for two reasons: <b>to be master</b> of style, form and content of my space here on the
    web, enabling me to customize it however I want and to express myself freely — the exact opposite of what social
    media offer. Secondly, <b>to store</b> all my thoughts and writings in a single place, overcoming the dependency on
    countless journals, pieces of paper, and note taking apps.</p>

    <h3>How?</h3>
    <p>The entire website is written in plain <b>HTML/CSS</b>, with as little <b>Javascript</b> as possible.<br>
    While being a perpetual <a href="/todo/">work in progress</a>, this site is <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last">designed to last</a>.</p>

    <h3>Privacy</h3>
    <p>There are <b>no <span translate="no">trackers</span></b>, analytics, nor <span translate="no">cookies</span>. I don't care
    who you are, where you are or why you've come here.<br>
    Also, I don't really want to know the number of readers: it would either be <span style="font-family: var(--font-monospace);">0</span> or
    <span style="font-family: var(--font-monospace);">>0</span> and I'd obsess over nothing in both scenarios.</p>

  {a: "Before Sunrise", t: "That’s what I like about traveling – you can it down, maybe talk to someone interesting, see something beautiful, read a good book, and that’s enough to qualify as a good day. You do that at home and everyone thinks you’re a bum."},
  {a: "Before Sunset", t: "I guess when you are young, you believe that you will meet many people with whom you'll connect with, but later in life you realize it only happens a few times."},
  {a: "Before Sunset", t: "Yeah, a memory's never finished, if you really think about it."},

  {a: "C.S. Lewis", t: "It is a good rule after reading a new book, never to allow yourself another new one till you have read an old one in between."},
  {a: "Carlos Ruiz Zafón", t: "Books are mirrors: you only see in them what you already have inside you."},
  {a: "Carlos Ruiz Zafón", t: "Every book has a soul. The soul of the person who wrote it and of those who read it and lived and dreamed with it. Every time a book changes hands, every time someone runs his eyes down its pages, its spirit grows and strengthens."},
  {a: "Carlos Ruiz Zafón", t: "Destiny is usually just around the corner. Like a thief, a hooker, or a lottery vendor: its three most common personifications. But what destiny does not do is home visits. You have to go for it."},

  {a: "Dead Poets Society", t: "I sound my barbaric YAWP over the rooftops of the world."},

  {a: "Donna Tartt", t: "'We think we have many desires, but in fact we have only one. What is it?' 'To live,' said Camilla. 'To live forever'"},
  {a: "Donna Tartt", t: "Any action, in the fullness of time, sinks to nothingness."},
  {a: "Donna Tartt", t: "It is is better to know one book intimately than a hundred superficially."},
  {a: "Donna Tartt", t: "There are such things as ghosts. People everywhere have always known that. And we believe in them every bit as much as Homer did. Only now, we call them by different names. Memory. The unconscious."},
  {a: "Donna Tartt", t: "Does such a thing as 'the fatal flaw,' that showy dark crack running down the middle of a life, exist outside literature? I used to think it didn't. Now I think it does. And I think that mine is this: a morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs."},
  {a: "Donna Tartt", t: "Beauty is rarely soft or consolatory. Quite the contrary. Genuine beauty is always quite alarming."},
  {a: "Donna Tartt", t: "Forgive me, for all the things I did but mostly for the ones that I did not."},

  {a: "Emily Dickinson", t: "To live is so startling it leaves little room for other occupations."},
  {a: "Emily Dickinson", t: "Nature is a haunted house – but Art – is a house that tries to be haunted."},

  {a: "Everything Everywhere All At Once", t: "You think because l'm kind that it means I'm naive, and maybe I am. It's strategic and necessary. This is how I fight."},

  {a: "Frank Herbert", t: "It is impossible to live in the past, difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in the future."},

  {a: "Frank Herbert", t: "Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them."},
  {a: "Frank Herbert", t: "Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little bit to test that it's a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain."},
  {a: "Frank Herbert", t: "The concept of progress acts as a protective mechanism to shield us from the terrors of the future."},
